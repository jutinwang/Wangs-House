The goal of the project is to understand User Centered Design (UCD) principles and apply it to a resturant website. 

### Tech Stack
Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript

### Notes
- Javascript is used although it doesn't appear on the Github langauge breakdown.
- Javascript can be found in `reservation.html` and `menu.html` under a `<script>` tag.
- The google maps location found in `location.html` is a real resturant in Ottawa which has a similar name (and partily inspired the website and business).
- The `index.html` in the html folder is the home page. All important HTML documents are in the folder.
- The `index.html` found outside the folder is meant for github pages to read and load the website.
